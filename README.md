Flat Build
==========

This is part of the project around my personal page, [mariehogebrandt.se](http://mariehogebrandt.se). This particular repository has the bits and pieces that makes the HTML-mockups, with the build system and such. 

I am dividing it up to be able to show them one piece at the time, to avoid needing to explain everything in a single post.

## What is Flat Build?

My article on terminology [covers it better](http://mariehogebrandt.se/articles/terminology#flat-build), but the gist of it is that by building the frontend separately from the dynamic data it stays a touch more system-agnostic, and it also gets a lot easier to test the pieces separately.
